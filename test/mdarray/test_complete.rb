# MDArray main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table
# of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of 
# positive integers.  In MDArray dimensions are called <axes>.  The number of
# <axes> is rank.
#
# For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] is an array of
# rank 1, because it has one <axis>.  That <axis> has a length of 3. In 
# the example pictured below, the array has rank 2 (it is 2-dimensional).  The
# first dimension (axis) has length of 2, the second dimension has length of 3
# [[1, 0, 0],
#  [0, 1, 2]]
# The more important attributes of a MDArray object are:
# * ndim: the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.  The number of dimensions
# is referred to as rank
# * shape: the dimensions of the array.  This is a tuple of integers indicating 
# the size of the array in each dimension.  For a matrix with n rows and m 
# columns, shape will be (n, m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the
# rank, or number of dimensions, ndim
# * size: the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product
# of the elements of shape
# * dtype: an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can
# create or specify dtype's using standard Ruby types. Additionally MDArray 
# provides types of its own. (examples?)
# * itemsize: ??
# Differently from NumPy, it is not possible to get the internal buffer
